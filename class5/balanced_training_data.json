    "question": "Can you describe your experience working in an agile team?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! During my internship at Knewton, I collaborated with an agile team of six members. We followed a two-week sprint cycle where we held daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress and blockers. My role involved helping prioritize and scope feature requests, ensuring that we focused on the features that would provide the biggest impact first. For instance, we implemented a user feedback feature that allowed users to suggest improvements directly within the app, which increased user engagement significantly."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did you approach building test coverage for new features?",
    "answer": "I took a methodical approach to building test coverage for new features. I used pytest and unittest frameworks to develop comprehensive test cases. For instance, when we rolled out a new recommendation algorithm, I authored over 100 unit tests to cover various edge cases and scenarios. This rigorous testing process helped us reduce customer complaints by 23%, as we were able to identify and rectify potential issues before going live."

  {
    "question": "Can you give an example of how your data pipeline work led to a new site feature?",
    "answer": "Certainly! I was responsible for acquiring and ingesting data to build and maintain data pipelines using Apache Airflow and Python. Over a span of three months, I analyzed user interaction data and identified a trend showing that users were frequently abandoning their sessions at a specific point in the onboarding process. Based on this insight, we developed a simplified onboarding feature that guided users more effectively, resulting in a 6% increase in revenue as more users completed the onboarding process and converted to paying customers."

    "question": "Can you describe your experience with RESTful APIs during your internship at Knewton?",
    "answer": "During my internship at Knewton from April 2016 to April 2017, I worked closely with another developer to implement RESTful APIs using Django. This involved designing endpoints for internal analytics tools which significantly improved the speed of data reporting for our analytics team by 24%. For instance, we optimized data retrieval processes which allowed the team to generate reports in under 10 seconds instead of the previous 13 seconds, which was crucial for timely decision-making."

  {
    "question": "What role did you play in the unit testing infrastructure you built with Selenium?",
    "answer": "In my role as a Python Developer Intern, I was responsible for building a unit testing infrastructure for a client web application using Selenium. Over the course of about six months, I created a suite of automated tests that mimicked user interactions with the web app. As a result, we observed an 11% reduction in bugs reported by the client month over month. This not only improved the client\u2019s satisfaction but also reduced the time our team spent on manual testing, allowing us to focus on new feature development."

  {
    "question": "How did you approach diagnosing performance issues in applications at Knewton?",
    "answer": "Diagnosing performance issues was a critical part of my internship. I focused on identifying the root causes of slow application speeds by analyzing database query performance. I documented a systematic approach that included profiling database queries and optimizing them, which resulted in a more robust query system. For instance, I was able to reduce the average query time by over 30%, which drastically improved the overall application performance and user experience. This process not only enhanced my understanding of database management but also taught me the importance of documentation for future reference."

    "question": "Can you describe your experience working on the cryptocurrency price tracker project?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! I was the creator of the cryptocurrency price tracker project, which I developed over a span of four months. I utilized Python for backend development and made extensive use of PostgreSQL for efficient data storage. The project involved making API calls to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges to fetch real-time price data. We managed to track over 200 different cryptocurrencies, and I implemented features that enabled users to visualize price movements using D3.js. The interactive graphs that I created allowed users to select custom time frames, making it easier for them to analyze trends."

  {
    "question": "What role did you play in writing scalable code with your team of interns and a developer?",
    "answer": "In my role, I focused on collaborating with a team of four interns and one experienced developer for a math course application. Over a period of three months, we adopted Agile methodologies to ensure efficient collaboration. I took charge of implementing RESTful APIs that handled user requests, which significantly improved the application's scalability. By integrating best practices such as modular coding and thorough unit testing, we were able to enhance the codebase's maintainability, resulting in a 30% reduction in deployment time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you explain how you incorporated API calls for the cryptocurrency price tracker and how you managed the data?",
    "answer": "Certainly! For the cryptocurrency price tracker, I implemented API calls using Python's requests library to fetch data from three different cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase. This process was automated to run every minute to ensure that our users had access to the most current data. I used PostgreSQL to store the data efficiently, with a schema that included tables for historical prices, user preferences, and transaction records. By leveraging indexes, I optimized our queries, which improved data retrieval speed by approximately 25%. The entire system was designed to handle thousands of requests without performance degradation."
